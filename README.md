### **3. How to Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL in the System**  

#### **Frontend (User Interface)**
- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages (forms, buttons, property listings, user profiles).  
- **CSS**: Styling and layout (responsive design, animations, themes, mobile-friendly UI).  
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features (real-time search filters, property image sliders, chatbots).  

#### **Backend (Database & Server)**
- **Java**: Handles business logic, user authentication, and server-side processing.  
- **SQL**: Stores property data, user details, transaction history, and messages in a database.  

#### **Example Flow of the System**  
1. **User visits the site** → HTML & CSS display the UI.  
2. **User searches for properties** → JavaScript sends requests to fetch data dynamically.  
3. **Backend processes request** → Java interacts with SQL to fetch matching properties.  
4. **Results displayed dynamically** → JavaScript updates the page with new property listings.  
5. **User books property or pays online** → Java processes payments, updates SQL database.
